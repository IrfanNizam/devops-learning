# DevOps Learning Repository

This repository is a **hands-on DevOps learning workspace**.  
It contains practical exercises and small projects based on the **DevOps Roadmap by roadmap.sh**.

The goal is not to build a single large product, but to **systematically practice core DevOps concepts** in isolation, the same way they are encountered in real-world environments.

---

## Purpose

- Practice DevOps fundamentals through focused, self-contained exercises
- Reinforce understanding of systems, infrastructure, and automation
- Build muscle memory for tools commonly used in production
- Track personal progress across the DevOps roadmap

---

## Scope

The repository follows the structure and topics outlined in:

👉 https://roadmap.sh/devops

Each section focuses on **learning by doing**, rather than theory-heavy documentation.
